# Player harness

Spotify's full screen player mocked under its own class names and accessibility identifiers
(from `trees/clean/player/01.txt`), so the redesign's player can be laid out, animated and
looked at on the Mac without the phone.

    THEOS=$HOME/theos ./build.sh
    xcrun simctl install <udid> build/PlayerHarness.app
    SIMCTL_CHILD_HARNESS_SCENARIO=artwork xcrun simctl launch --console-pty <udid> com.vojta.playerharness
    xcrun simctl io <udid> screenshot shot.png

Launch it on an iOS 26 simulator by UDID. The iOS 27 runtime kills an app that has a scene manifest but
no scene delegate. `SRC=<another checkout>/tweak/Sources OUT=<dir> ./build.sh` builds it against other
sources, for example an older commit, to see a bug before its fix.

`build.sh` runs `logos.pl -c generator=internal` over `PlayerLyrics.x`, `PlayerArtwork.x`,
`PlayerFooter.x`, `PlayerControls.x`, `PlayerScroll.x`, `PlayerField.x` and the Kit's `SGRBridges.x`, and links them with
the real `Core/`, `Settings/`, `Redesigned/Kit/`, `PlayerBackgroundSettings.m` and `SGRKaraokeView`. `stubs.m` stands in for the hooks the harness
does not compile (the Kit's accent and repaint, the rest of the player, the lyrics store, the haptics)
and plays a mock player: `SGRHarnessSetTrack` reports a track, with the image ids Spotify's metadata
carries, to every state observer. A song of ten timed lines plays on from launch. `main.m` also answers
for i.scdn.co through an `NSURLProtocol` handed to every session, so each picture the Kit fetches can
come late, out of order, or not at all.

`HARNESS_SCENARIO` picks what the harness does:

- `lyrics` (default) opens the lyrics at 2 s, closes them at 6 and opens them again at 10.
- `look` plays one track, then a track from another album at 8 s, whose picture reaches the screens
  0.4 s later. It shows the field, the moving background and its crossfade, and the footer row. At 3 s
  it logs whether touches on the lowered footer row (issue #54) still reach it.
- `artwork` is issue #58. Tracks change while the covers on screen lag behind (3.5 s late, past the
  Kit's last look), two skips come in a row with the older picture answering last, and one track plays
  offline. Each step checks by colour that the Kit and the field show that track's picture, and the log
  ends with `artwork checks: n of 4 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`. Before the fix it read 1 of 4.
- `taps` puts real touches on the player (`touches.m`, KIF's way: a UITouch and an IOHIDEvent sent
  through UIApplication, so hit testing, gesture recognizers and UIControl tracking all run): taps on
  the progress bar, on and beside it, with the lyrics up and not, the thumb's own drag and a tap on it,
  the times and the rows around the bar, a lyric line, and the lyrics' thumbnail with the controls
  there and with the lines alone. The duration unit is Spotify's position slider under its own class
  name, wired the way the binary wires it (began on touch down, a seek on touch up). The log ends with
  `tap checks: n of 25 right -- PASS` or `FAIL`. The iOS 26 UISlider lets go of a touch only once its
  thumb has settled, and a tap is delivered to the views late through the list's delayed touches, as
  on the phone.
- `fluid` is the Fluid artwork background: another album at 7 s (the crossfade), paused from 11 to 13 s, the
  player's open or close announced at 15 s, Speed, Saturation and Blur pushed at 17 s and put back at 20 s,
  as the page's sliders do. The log's `redesign warp:` lines pair the link's runs and stops with each step
  and give its cost a frame.

`HARNESS_BACKGROUND=0|1|2` stores Still artwork, Colour flow or Fluid artwork (unset is the default), and
`HARNESS_OLD_MOTION=0` the Moving background switch it replaced, off. `HARNESS_COVER=<path>` starts on a
picture of your own; keep real covers out of the repo.

`HARNESS_VOLUME=0` leaves out the volume row that the phone has and the tree does not.
`HARNESS_FREE=1` builds the units under the class names Spotify Free's player gives them
(`ReinventFree_ReinventFreeNpvImpl`), around the same elements; the log should read as it does without it.

A screen recording is the way to see a move:

    xcrun simctl io <udid> recordVideo -f run.mp4      # ^C to stop
    ffmpeg -ss 7.4 -t 2.2 -i run.mp4 -vf "fps=5,scale=180:-1,tile=11x1" -frames:v 1 strip.png

It also lays every unit out once a second, which is what the transforms on Spotify's title row and the
narrowed marquee labels have to survive.

What it does not cover: the real element framework's autolayout, Spotify's own scrolled layout, the
player's open and close transition, and Spotify's real image loading.
